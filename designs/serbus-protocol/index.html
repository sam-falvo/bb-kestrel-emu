   </h1>
   <h2>
    Background
   </h2>
   <p>
    The 65xx bus, being single-cycle (meaning, one CPU cycle maps to one
    memory cycle), makes creating expansion backplanes for it somewhat
    difficult due to the timing requirements involved.  As if that
    weren't enough, the relative expense of creating peripherals is
    worsened by expensive connector technologies.  The most prevalent
    method is to use PCI slots, which can cost upwards of $4 per slot if
    you know where to get them.  This is also true for 96-pin Eurocard
    connectors too.  For an interconnect, that's quite hefty in terms of
    price.
   </p>
   <p>
    From a mechanical point of view, there is the minor issue of deciding
    the final form-factor of the product as well.  In particular, do you
    want 2 slots?  4 slots?  8 slots?  Maybe 6?  How far apart do we
    space them?  Are they buffered or unbuffered?  Do we expose the raw
    CPU bus, or make a CPU independent bus?  What if I don't want a card
    cage at all?  What if I do, but want it to be a half-rack unit
    instead of a full-rack unit?  If I design it for a rack unit, how
    many Us do I make it?  I think you get the idea.
   </p>
   <p>
    These issues all add to the expense of solving the basic problem:
    getting data from point A, to point B.  None of these issues address
    the software side of things either!
   </p>
   <p>
    The operating system would need to be aware of how to probe the
    attached hardware for device identification, so that it may
    intelligently seek out the suitable device drivers.  Or, maybe the
    card will place its own drivers in ROM.  Or, maybe the OS will load
    the drivers into local RAM from a ROM-disk provided by the card.  Do
    I have split configuration and I/O spaces?  Do I merge configuration,
    I/O, and drivers into a single address space?  Do I use parallel ROMs
    or serial ROMs for storing driver/device ID information?  Etc.
   </p>
   <p>
    The hardware is greatly simplified by employing a basic serial
    interface, to be documented elsewhere.  However, a side effect of
    using a serial interface is that peripherals <i>must</i> employ some
    element of intelligence in order to be useful.  It is not possible,
    with the resources available to the Kestrel, for the hardware to
    perform a write to an I/O location, and to have that write
    transmitted over the serial link, to be decoded by a remote DMA
    engine (indeed, this is precisely how Firewire works, but requires
    extremely specialized hardware on both sides of the link for this to
    work).  Therefore, a higher-level protocol must be defined to enable
    a cheap interconnect to have maximum benefit.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Layer 2 Overview
   </h2>
   <h3>
    Channels Versus Peripherals
   </h3>
   <p>
    A single <i>peripheral</i>, that which the user plugs into the Serbus,
    will often maintain more than one single item of functionality.  For
    example, a storage controller that provides an IDE interface can
    support 2 IDE peripherals (typically harddrives).  A SCSI controller
    may provide for 7 devices.  Devices need not even expose the same
    functionality.  A console peripheral might support a keyboard and a
    mouse, for example.
   </p>
   <p>
    Whether the host software communicates with these functionalities
    through a single command-based interface or through multiple separate
    <i>channels</i> of communications with the peripheral depends
    entirely on the implementation of the peripheral.  Channel 0 is used
    for discovery of the kind of device, and therefore, its supported
    protocol of communication as well.  If no other channels are
    supported, then all primary device activity must also occur over
    channel 0.
   </p>
   <p>
    At this high a conceptual level, you can think of device channel 0 as
    a directory service, of sorts, which leads software to other
    supported device channels as appropriate.  Note that this protocol
    specification <i>does</i> permit channels to be created on-demand if
    required.  For example, mass storage devices with integrated
    filesystems may map each open file to a separate, dynamically
    allocated channel.  (ISSUE: Should we use <i>host-allocated</i>
    channels instead?)
   </p>
   <p>
    It should be noted that nothing in the bus protocol restricts
    channels to input-only or output-only.  The protocol implicitly
    assumes that all channels are bidirectional capable.  Whether a
    channel is unidirectional or not is a peripheral-specific attribute.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Talkers and Listeners
   </h3>
   <p>
    Borrowing some concepts from the GPIB, the Serbus (as with Commodore's
    own IEC serial bus) defines the concept of <i>listeners</i> and
    <i>talkers</i>.  A listener is any <i>channel</i> which is currently
    <i>accepting data from the host system</i>.  The protocol supports
    having more than one listener active at a time, though it is
    generally not employed.  Likewise, a <i>talker</i> is any channel
    which is currently <i>transmitting data to the host system</i>.  Only
    one talker is permitted per Serbus device.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unlike GPIB and IEC buses, it is <i>not</i> possible for peripherals
    to address each other directly; the Serbus protocol is strictly
    master/slave in its architecture.  This stems directly from the
    nature of the SPI bus, on which Serbus is built.
   </p>
   <h2>
    Layer 2 Commands
   </h2>
   <p>
    When a peripheral's /DEVSEL signal is asserted, the peripheral is to
    immediately enter <i>attention</i> state, whereby it will listen for
    traffic management commands on the bus.  These commands include the
    following:
   </p>
   <table>
    <tr>
     <th>Command Name</th>
     <th>Wire Format</th>
     <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>ECHO</td>
     <td>$00 <i>any arbitrary length of data</i></td>
     <td>Instructs the peripheral to echo the data back on the link.
         This is primarily intended for use in debugging.  Because Serbus
         is based on SPI links, arbitrary lengths are supported by just
         echoing back bytes when they are received.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>TALK</td>
     <td>$01 <i>channel-id</i></td>
     <td>Instructs a given channel to transmit any pending data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>LISTEN</td>
     <td>$02 <i>number-of-channels channel-id-1 ... optional-data</td>
     <td>Instructs a given channel(s) to listen to any data
         forthcoming.  It is possible to send a zero-length frame by
         simply not including any data.</td>
    </tr>
   </table>
   <h2>
    Framing
   </h2>
   <p>
    The peripheral's /DEVSEL line delineates framing, thus eliminating the
    need for both frame delimiter bytes, wire-level encoding, and for
    GPIB-style UNTALK and UNLISTEN commands.  All of these features are
    implicit.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Talkers
   </h3>
   <p>
    It is possible for /DEVSEL to be negated while a peripheral is still
    talking.  This means that some data on a channel may not yet be read.
    This data will remain queued up until it is either read via another TALK
    command, or until explicitly flushed with a device-specific command.
   </p>
   <p>
    Let us suppose that we have a simple device that simply echos
    whatever it receives on channel 1 back onto channel 1.  Assume we
    dump the two null-terminated strings "HELLO" and "WORLD" to channel
    1.  Therefore, we've just queued up a total of 12 bytes on channel 1.
    After executing a TALK 1 command, it will respond first with the
    length of the data pending on channel 1 (in this case 12), followed
    by the string of bytes present.
   </p>
   <p>
    But, suppose we read back only 6 data bytes in the first transaction
    by negating /DEVSEL midway through.  The device will still have 6 bytes
    queued up (at least).  Therefore, the next TALK 1 command will
    respond with a length of 6 (at least), followed by the remaining
    bytes.
   </p>
   <p>
    Through this mechanism, it should be possible to respond to
    higher-priority, interrupting devices with more rapid response time,
    without interrupting the integrity of the data being received from
    other peripherals.
   </p>
   <p>
    If the data currently pending is to be discarded, a separate,
    device-specific command directed to the appropriate channel (usually,
    but not necessarily always, 0) is required.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Listeners
   </h3>
   <p>
    It is possible for /DEVSEL to be negated while a peripheral is still
    listening.  The negation of /DEVSEL is sufficient to terminate a
    single write operation, which usually doesn't cause any harm in the
    event that a higher priority peripheral needs to be tended to.
    However, some devices may expect an integral
    number of bytes before acting on a command.  If it is desired that
    this data be discarded and the command cancelled, a separate,
    device-specific command directed to the appropriate channel (usually,
    but not necessarily always, 0) is required.
